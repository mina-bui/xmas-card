            <p>To Michael and Jeff,</p>
            <p>
                Thank you both for being such great instructors- it's been a rough year for all of us, from getting used
                to online learning to technical difficulties galore. But you guys have gone above and beyond for us,
                always available and willing to help us understand our work, and that's super appreciated!
                <br>
                Looking back on the past three months, it really feels like we've gone a long way - and that's all
                thanks to you guys :)
            </p>
            <p>Wishing you guys a very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</p>

                Thank you for all you've brought to teaching us. Every day, both of you bring such a clear passion and
                care. It's honestly inspiring, and very much appreciated. I hope you both have a wonderful and relaxing
                holiday this Christmas - you definitely deserve it.
            </p>
            <p>
                (Also Michael I'm sure you'll still be around in the new year, but Jeff I know we're all gonna miss you
                teaching us!)

                Thank you both for all the knowledge and support you've given us during the last 3 months. Although it
                has been
                difficult, entering each and every lecture with instructors who are super passionate about programming
                has made learning
                more rewarding. Happy Holidays!

                I'm super grateful for all of the help you have both provided through every challenging lesson, lab and
                project. It
                can't be easy talking to a bunch of squares in a zoom meeting and we all appreciate how much work and
                enthusiasm you put
                into every class. Thank you for being such wonderful instructors and for everything you have taught us.
                Wishing you and

                I can’t thank you enough for all of your support and encouragement throughout the beginning of this
                program. You both
                have been extremely patient, kind and knowledgable, and it has not gone unnoticed. We all appreciate you
                very much. I
                hope you have a wonderful, relaxing holiday!
                <br>

                Thank you both for being such incredible instructors! Coding can be quite
                intimidating sometimes, but with your patience and encouragement, it doesn't
                seem like an impossible task anymore. We appreciate all you have taught us.

                Michael: Looking forward to seeing you on zoom every so often for the remainder
                of the program :)
